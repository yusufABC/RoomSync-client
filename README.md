## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Users can register/login with email-password or Google. Protected routes redirect unauthorized users to the login page.

- 📝 **Add, Update, and Delete Roommate Listings**  
  Authenticated users can add new listings, view their own listings in a table, update existing posts, and delete them with confirmation.

- 📊 **Browse All Listings**  
  Users can browse all roommate posts submitted by others in a dynamic table format, with “See More” buttons linking to detailed views.

- ❤️ **Like Mechanism with Access Control**  
  On the Details page, users can like other users' posts multiple times — but not their own. Liking reveals the contact number.

- 🎨 **Beautiful, Responsive & Themed UI**  
  Fully responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop. Includes dark/light theme toggle, Lottie animations, typewriter effect, and reveal transitions for a polished UX.
